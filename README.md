| ![libftm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb2bdf5c-af93-40f4-9049-e0df44a218cb) | <div align="center">**[Libft](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--1_Libft)**</div> | This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.	| *The first project in the 42 curriculum consists of creating a library in C that can be used in future projects. The goal is to solve recurring problems, such as allocating memory, copying memory, printing strings, counting characters, among others. A library of custom functions in ANSI C, designed for learning, customization, and reuse. These functions are typically alternative or complementary implementations of functions in the C standard library (stdlib.h, string.h, etc.).*	| <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Imperative programming</li><ul> |
| ![get_next_linem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e9bd94-ac95-45be-9a0b-5701f5c8bf79) | <div align="center">**[get_next_line](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--2_Get_Next_Line)**</div> | May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects. | *Is a C function that reads a file line by line and returns the next line from the file descriptor. It is a custom implementation of the getline function from the C standard library.* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Unix</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><ul> |
| ![ft_printfm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5a58cc-fc0b-4697-a770-1cae4bc7a7a3) | <div align="center">**[ft_printf](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--3_Fprintf)**</div> | This project is pretty straightforward, you will have to recode printf. You will learn what it is and how to implement variadic functions. Once validated, you will reuse this function in your future projects. | *Is a function found in the stdio.h library and is mainly used to print a specific output on the terminal's standard output (stdout -> fd = 1).* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><ul> |

The project consists of creating a virtual machine with an SSH server and configuring it according to the project rules.*	| <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Network & system administration</li><ul> |
| ![fract-olm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6393d321-fabe-441d-b22e-d711f16b08c6) | <div align="center">**[fract-ol](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--5_Fract-ol)**</div> | Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX. | *Teaches how to manipulate a low-level graphics library and advanced mathematical concepts. It consists of creating fractals from complex numbers in an iterative mathematical structure.*	| <ul><li>Imperative programming</li><li>Graphics</li><ul> |
| ![minitalkm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfbd3c6b-bb3a-4ba2-9301-9e94aaf27c29) | <div align="center">**[Minitalk](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--6_Minitalk)**</div> | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. | *It consists of creating a data exchange program that uses UNIX signals to allow communication between a client and a server. The objective is to send a string from the client to the server using only the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.*	| <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Unix</li><ul> |
