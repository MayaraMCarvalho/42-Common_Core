You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.	| *The first project in the 42 curriculum consists of creating a library in C that can be used in future projects. The goal is to solve recurring problems, such as allocating memory, copying memory, printing strings, counting characters, among others. A library of custom functions in ANSI C, designed for learning, customization, and reuse. These functions are typically alternative or complementary implementations of functions in the C standard library (stdlib.h, string.h, etc.).*	| <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Imperative programming</li><ul> |

It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects. | *Is a C function that reads a file line by line and returns the next line from the file descriptor. It is a custom implementation of the getline function from the C standard library.* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Unix</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><ul> |
| ![ft_printfm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5a58cc-fc0b-4697-a770-1cae4bc7a7a3) | <div align="center">**[ft_printf](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/42--3_Fprintf)**</div> | This project is pretty straightforward, you will have to recode printf. You will learn what it is and how to implement variadic functions. Once validated, you will reuse this function in your future projects. | *Detalhes do Projeto* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Imperative programming</li><ul> |
