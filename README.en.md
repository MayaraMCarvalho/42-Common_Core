You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus. | *The first project in the 42 curriculum consists of creating a library in C that can be used in future projects. The goal is to solve recurring problems, such as allocating memory, copying memory, printing strings, counting characters, among others. A library of custom functions in ANSI C, designed for learning, customization, and reuse. These functions are typically alternative or complementary implementations of functions in the C standard library (stdlib.h, string.h, etc.).* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Imperative programming</li><ul> |

To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting. | *The goal is to sort a stack of numbers (stack A) using a second stack (stack B) as a helper. The challenge is to do this with the fewest possible operations (like push, swap, rotate), by implementing an efficient sorting algorithm.* | <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Unix</li><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Imperative programming</li><ul> |
